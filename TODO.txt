Todo list from rfuse:

*Unit Test
*Multithreading
*Better Error handling
*Test,test,test

Todo list for ng:

Basicly same as above, except:

A lot of testing has been done and an army of bugs was slaughtered in
the process, so rfuse-ng can be called "beta", means other folks have
to test it probably by trying to do something useful.

Error handling still needs to be improved greatly. Stuff needs logging
(syslog?) with different verbosity levels to support developement and
still don't litter the logs on production systems.

Multithreading is still a mistery for me, but definitely a must to have
feature.

Since manual testing takes up some 60% of my time, I desperately need
unit tests, so this item still valid too.

BUG: find out why kernel parameter passing behaves very oddly (see
test-ruby.rb for details).
